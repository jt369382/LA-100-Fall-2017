# Code of Conduct

### 0. Introduction
Learning is a dynamic activity that involves effort and interaction on the part of all parties involved. All participants in the classroom experience have expectations. In addition, there are two main roles that occur in the classroom: student and instructor.  Note that the individuals that play these roles may change over the course of the term and even within a class meeting. This code of conduct applies to the LA 100 classroom. 

### 1. Definition

A code of conduct is a document that establishes expectations for behavior and participation in a project, in this case all interactions related to the LA-100 class. A code of conduct supports healthy, constructive community behavior. (https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)

### 2. Purpose

A primary goal of Western New England University is to be inclusive to the largest number of community members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines expectations for all those who participate in LA-100 as a subcommunity of Western New England University, as well as the consequences for code violations and unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in LA-100 to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### 3. LA-100 Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase WNE citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.
<HOW DO WE MAKE THIS VISIBLE?>

### 4. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
 * Participate in an authentic and active way both inside and out of class time. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. This includes regular class attendance.
 * Be punctual when arriving for class.
 * Arrive at class prepared including all readings and assignments completed.
 * Ask for help if you are encountering trouble with an assignment.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

#### 4.A Expectations of Instructor

The instructor should be:
 * Receptive to student concerns
 * Available during office hours and by appointment
 * Fair in grading
 * Relatively prompt in returning graded coursework
 * Responsive to student emails within 24 hours except on weekends
 * Prompt in posting all course changes to the Kodiak site
 * Willing to offer help if instructor notes a student having difficulty

Students are encouraged to think independently and you may openly disagree with the instructor or others in class, but you must respond thoughtfully; do not “get personal.”  You are encouraged to critique, question, or challenge ideas but you are not to attack individuals.

### 5. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:
 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
 * Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
 * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
 * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
A more detailed list of unacceptable behaviors may be found in the Western New England University Student Handbook (http://www1.wne.edu/student-activities/doc/Handbook-Updated.pdf)

### 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior and Reporting

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, procedures as outlined in the Western New England University Student Handbook (http://www1.wne.edu/student-activities/doc/Handbook-Updated.pdf) Article IV will be followed.

We expect all community participants (students, faculty members, administrators, and guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

### 7. Timeliness
All members of the LA 100 community are expected to....
A deliverable is late when it is submitted after the due date and time. Legitimate lateness include approved illness, family emergencies and death, and athlectic events. 
1. One day grace period and one letter grade per day afterwards
  1.A limited number of grace days 
3. One or two grace "assignments".
2. Each day after it is late, lose five points up to a max of five days. 
  2.A 5 points first day, 10 points 2nd day, etc. up to five

### 8. Participation
Participation is defined as being awake, alert and attentive during class, engaged in the class including raising your hand, doing your work, contributing to group work, sharing thoughts. 

Being absent from class is defined as not here physically or mentally, not here for more than half the class physically.  A legitimate absence includes sickness, family emergency, informed previous committment such as sports or club travel, weather-related reasons.  

Being late means 5-15 minutes is late, after 15 minutes is absent
 
3-20 minutes is late, after 20 minutes is absent
5-20 minutes is late, after 20- is absent
after class starting

A legitimate lateness is getting lost, clubs, sports - need warning ahead of time, going over time in another class 
- <6 total absences and latenesses not including legitimate latenesses

Consequence: one point off final grade for every unexcused absence > 3 

Instructor has no obligation to provide extra support or time for unexcused absences. 





### 9. Attention
Attention is when you are focusing on what is being tought in class and not having your focus on anything else.

Examples of acceptable distractions would be looking at your phone quickly to see a message; if it is a emergency, then you can step out of the classroom raising your hand and asking the instructor first.

The cost for distraction would be getting a 0 for participation for that class.

The reward for paying attention in class is knowledge. :)
